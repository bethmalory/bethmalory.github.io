Welcome to my website. Feel free to look around but please excuse anything that isn't quite finished- it is still under construction. 

I am Lecturer in English Linguistics within the [Department of English Language and Literature](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/english/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), and a Visiting Research Fellow within the [Department of Linguistics and English Language](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/) at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/), where I also completed my PhD.

My research aims to understand how innovative corpus linguistic approaches can help to further understanding of the mechanisms through which languages change over time. I am particularly interested in linguistic changes prompted by prescriptivism, and exploring how new methodologies can help us to understand these. Much of my research also draws upon discourse studies, and explores how social hierarchies are created and perpetuated discursively. I have previously been involved in research across a wide range of related linguistic sub-disciplines, for example the [SAMUELS Project](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/research/fundedresearchprojects/samuels/) and the [Spoken Learner Corpus Project](https://www.trinitycollege.com/about-us/research/Trinity-corpus).

Current research
======
At present, my primary research interests lie in the relationship between different types of prescriptivism (for instance progressive/politically responsive or conservative/standardizing) and language change. My research explores methodological approaches that can be used to examine the mechanisms through which prescriptive dogma impacts language use, and I am particularly interested in the ways in which 'inclusive' language guidelines are implemented, particularly in the context of gender and sexuality in obstetric and gynaecological care. I am currently working on the following projects: 

* LanGuAGE: Language Guidelines for Adverse Gestational Events. I am working with charities including [Tommy's](https://www.tommys.org/), [Sands](https://www.sands.org.uk/), and [ARC](https://www.arc-uk.org/) to explore the impact of language on experiences of pregnancy loss and create evidence-based language guidelines for pregnancy loss language in healthcare.
* Analysing the Language of Speciesism (ALaS, funded by [Animal Think Tank](https://animalthinktank.org.uk/)). 
* *Introducing Linguistics*. I am co-editing a new linguistics textbook, to be published by Routledge in 2022 (with [Jonathan Culpeper](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/about/people/jonathan-culpeper), [Dimitrinka Atanasova](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/about/people/dimitrinka-atanasova), [Aina Casaponsa](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/about/people/aina-casaponsa), [Sam Kirkham](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/about/people/sam-kirkham), [Claire Nance](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/about/people/claire-nance), and [Daniel Van Olmen](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/linguistics/about/people/daniel-van-olmen)). 


Potential collaborations and supervision
======
Please get in touch if you would like to discuss ideas or collaborations in any of the areas mentioned above. I would be especially excited to discuss possible collaborations in relation to the following:

* Applications of change point analysis to (corpus) linguistic data
* Discursive investigations of prescriptivism, patriarchy, kyriarchy, speciesism, or other manifestations of social hierarchy
* Methodologies for measuring effects of prescriptivism
* Theoretical frameworks for understanding politically responsive prescriptivism
